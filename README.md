# Description
This is a recpsitory of the ML projects I worked on during my undergrad in physics: 

- Some of the projects for the class [Introduction to Intelligent Systems](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/tree/master/Introduccion_a_los_sistemas_inteligentes_2018-1) given in the secon semester of 2018.
- A [reproduction of the results on the fluctuation theorems of the RBM](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/tree/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML), following the [paper by Domingos Salazar](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/non%20equilibrium%20thermodynamics%20of%20RBM.pdf)
