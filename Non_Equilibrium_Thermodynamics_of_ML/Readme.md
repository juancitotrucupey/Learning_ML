# Description

In this repoditory you will find the reproduction of the paper [Non equilibriuym thermodynamics of RBM](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/non%20equilibrium%20thermodynamics%20of%20RBM.pdf). It is organized as follows

- We provide a [reproduction of the derivation of the fluctuation relations for the RBM](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/nonequilibrium-thermodynamics-rbm.pdf)
- An [implementation of an RBM from scratch in tensorflow](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/tree/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/RBM/rbm_class)
- A [script to train an RBM](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/RBM/Trainning.py)
- A [script to test the XFT using Gibbs sampling on the RBM](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/RBM/Test_XFT.py)
- A [notebook to train the RBM and perform the computations to test the XFT theorem on an RBM](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/RBM/RBM.ipynb)
- A [notebook to visualice the resutls of using the RBM with different temperatures](https://github.com/juancitotrucupey/Learning_ML/blob/master/Non_Equilibrium_Thermodynamics_of_ML/DatosRBM/DatosRBM/Graficas.ipynb), it also contains the graph of the verification of the XFT for the RBM.
